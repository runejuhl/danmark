Danmark
=======

Small scripts for extraction information from publicly available
documents that really should be available in other than proprietary
formats. Currently more intention than code.

Post codes
----------
Run `./scripts/postdk-post_codes.py` to generate a JSON and a YAML
file containing all post codes in Denmark from the information
available from Post Danmark. Note that the script downloads the XLS
file, so remove the file from `./files/` in order to re-download.
